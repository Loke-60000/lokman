            Greetings, esteemed lab member! The moment has arrived for you to contribute to the creation of Amadeus. You might be wondering, "How?" Allow me to explain.
            A few months back, we crafted our first chatbot with 7 billion parameters, drawing from Kurisu's inputs. We christened it "Christina-7B". However, its responses were, regrettably, inconsistent. That's where you come in!
            Lend us a bit of your time to generate new training data. Simply complete the form below, and feel free to submit multiple entries.
            Your contributions to the data will directly influence the evolution of Christina-7B's second version. Thank you for being part of this journey!
        </p>
